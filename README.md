## About

This project can be used to redirect users to random destinations. The user can't guess the link target, because the URL is obfuscated and Base64URL-encoded.

### Why could this be useful?

- Some link visitors are going to be rickrolled, and some aren't. (ok that's not really useful tbh)

## Self hosting

This project can be self-hosted. Currently only available for `apache2` webservers with activated PHP 8+ and `.htaccess` configuration enabled.
